# Automatic COVID19 Report Generator
This project aims to reads web data about districtwise COVID19 data for states in India and plot districtwise bar graph for total cases, total recoveries, total deaths and active cases.
The code contained in this repository is based on Kerala, but the same code can be adapted for all the states in India with relatively minor modifications to the constants section. The output of the programme is a png image containing the stats and bar chart of COVID cases on the day the code was run.
